/***********************************************Patient Doctor Connection web App*/
/*In the midst of the global pandemic, the world witnessed an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems. Many patients struggled to get timely medical consultations due to lockdowns, social distancing norms, and overwhelmed hospitals. Witnessing the challenges faced by patients and doctors alike, I realized the urgent need for a solution that could bridge the gap between healthcare providers and those in need of medical attention.
Drawing from my background in web development and my passion for using technology to solve real-world problems, I envisioned a platform that would enable seamless, virtual consultations. The idea was to create a web app where patients could easily find and book appointments with doctors, ensuring that medical advice was just a few clicks away, no matter the circumstances.
I began working on the project, leveraging technologies like React.js for a responsive and user-friendly client-side experience, and Node.js for a robust server-side. The platform, named Care-Link, was designed to have separate dashboards for patients and doctors. Patients could book appointments, while doctors could manage their schedules and patient interactions efficiently.*/
